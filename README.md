# Catan

This is a personal project designed for practicing code architecture for game logic using modern **C++**.

The content of this project is directly related to the famous board game [Catan](https://www.catan.com/).

The solution is divided into several projects:

- **Catan**: The main project; it contains the code of the game logic, as a static library.
- **CatanTest**: Unit tests project that uses the main library and tests it using gTest framework.
- **GoogleTest**: Helper project (gTest).
- **TestGuiProject**: Command Line Interface in order to do some manual test of the main library. (Currently NOT UP TO DATE, might no compile).

The project overall is still unfinished, but the main parts of the game logic are here, which was the priority.

Any suggestion or feedback is more than welcomed :)
